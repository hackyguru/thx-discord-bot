# Thx Discord Bot for incentivizing meet and greet

The bot is integrated with the presently available discord bot of THX. The THX Bot can be used to reward message authors with ERC20 tokens from a pool by reacting with certain emojies on their contributions in a channel. You can also conduct polls through the bot by using /poll command. It is possible to host rewarded polls where the community members can vote and the highest voted mention would automatically be rewarded.

### Prerequisites

#### 1. [Signup for a THX account](https://www.thx.network/signup)

Signup is free while we are in beta so let's give it a try!

#### 2. [Create an Application & ERC20 pool](https://dashboard.thx.network)

The application is used to authorize with our API. You can create your own ERC20 token with a limited or unlimited supply and deploy it in a fresh asset pool. Deploying your smart contract can take up to ~20 seconds.

> Make sure to edit you asset pool after deployment and disable the governance setting. This feature is currently not supported by the THX Bot.

#### 3. [Invite THX Bot to your guild](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=834083368370700299&permissions=8&scope=bot)

By clicking this link you will be asked which guild the THX Bot should join.
